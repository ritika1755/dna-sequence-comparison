# DNA SEQUENCE COMPARISON

<h2>Problem Statment:To provide insights into the structural and functional properties of the DNA sequences, such as the presence of conserved domains or regulatory regions.</h2>


This Python code compares two DNA sequences using two algorithms called Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The LCS algorithm finds the longest common subsequence between the two sequences, which represents the portion of the sequences that is most similar. The LIS algorithm then finds the longest subsequence in increasing order within the LCS, which can provide insights into the functional properties of the DNA sequences.


The purpose of this code is to provide insights into the structural and functional properties of DNA sequences, such as the presence of conserved domains or regulatory regions. By comparing DNA sequences, scientists can learn about the similarities and differences between organisms, the function of different genes, and the evolution of species. This code provides a tool to aid in this research and to help scientists gain a better understanding of the structural and functional properties of DNA.


<h2>How to Use</h2>


To use this code, run the create_gui() function, which will create a graphical user interface. Enter two DNA sequences in the input boxes and click the "Compare" button. The LCS and LIS results will be displayed in the output box.


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>


This code uses Python and the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface.
